## üé® Usage

Once the app is running, you'll see:

* A border-rounded section serving as the main canvas container.
* Canvas size information (e.g. `size √ó size ‚Ä¢ Xk pixels`).
* A legend displaying the current tool and color.
* A scrollable drawing area using `overflow-auto` and a height set with `calc(100vh - 220px)` for responsive design.
* A pixel grid where each cell reflects its own color and interactions through mouse/touch events.

Use your pointer to draw, erase, or fill cells. Pointer events (`onPointerDown`, `onPointerEnter`, `onPointerUp`, etc.) ensure smooth interaction across devices.
